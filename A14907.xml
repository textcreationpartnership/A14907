            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:20216:3"/> knoweth the place thereof: for he looketh to the ends of the earth, and ſeeth under the whole heaven. The wiſedome which <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh of here, is Gods ſecret wiſedome in his workes of nature, which none of the world, although they were as ſharpe ſighted as the Eagle, can underſtand. Now if man be ſo ignorant in Gods workes of nature, much more is he in the workes of grace; and he may ſay as <hi>Agur</hi> ſayd, when he conſidered <hi>Ithiel</hi> and <hi>Vcal</hi> (Ieſus Chriſt the wiſedome of the Father) ſurely I am more brutiſh <note place="margin">Pro. 30. 2,</note> then any man, and have not the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a man. <hi>David</hi> when he lookt upon the heavens, the workes of Gods hands, he <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 1.</note> ſayd; The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſhoweth his handy worke: then he telleth how they declare his glory and what ſort of Preachers they be, The vniverſality of their preaching, their line is gone out through all the earth even, to the ends of the world; Then their diligence in preaching, both day and night; Laſtly, how plainely they preach, n all languages. Yet this their preaching is but an indiſtinct ſort of preaching in reſpect of the preaching of the Goſpel. We may ſee ſome of his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:20216:3"/> in the heavens which are his handy worke: but nothing of the hid treaſure and riches hid up in Ieſus Chriſt, can we learne by this preaching. But <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the preaching of the Goſpel by the Apoſtles, ſaith, their ſound went out into all the earth, and their words into the ends of the world; hee <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 18.</note> changeth their line into their ſound. There is a great difference betwixt theſe two ſorts of preaching, a naughty perſon winketh with his eyes, he ſpeaketh with his feete, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his fingers, but hee ſpeaketh more <note place="margin">Pro. 6. 13.</note> diſtinctly with his tongue: So the Lord preacheth indiſtinctly (as it were) by his worke; but by the ſound of his Goſpel, hee preacheth clearely and plainely. Where ſhall we finde theſe treaſures of grace and hid wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? this treaſure is to bee found in his Law; therefore the Iewes call it <hi>deſiderium mundi,</hi> and it is more to be deſired, than Gold yea than moſt fine Gold. The Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 10.</note> with ſtretched out neckes, deſire to looke into this myſterie; even as the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims with ſtretched out neckes looked downe to the propitiatorie. If the Angels <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 12.</note> have ſuch a deſire to behold this wiſedome, much more ſhould man have a deſire to
<pb facs="tcp:20216:4"/> ſearch into theſe myſteries: for he tooke not upon him the nature of Angels, but he tooke <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 16.</note> on him the ſeede of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Happie is that man that findeth this wiſedome, and the man that getteth underſtanding, this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is onely to be found in the Law of the <note place="margin">Pro. 3. 13.</note> Lord. I have indevoured (my Noble Lord) in this treatiſe to make ſome ſmall path for the younger ſort to this wiſedome; And I have abſtained from theſe queſtions which doe more hurt than good to the Church. <hi>Plutarch</hi> maketh mention of a number of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to one maid, but they fell to ſuch conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt themſelves, that they did teare her all in peeces: too many diſputations in effect doe rent the truth, <hi>&amp; nimium altercando amittitur veritas:</hi> the beſt way to come by the knowledge of the truth, is, to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the Text it ſelfe, and to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the phraſe of the holy Ghoſt ſpeaking in his owne language. Let it not ſeeme ſtrange to any, that I ſeeming a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould take this boldneſſe to offer theſe my labours to your Lordſhip. I cannot acknowledge ſuch ſtrangeneſſe: for wee have one Lord, one faith, one baptiſme, one <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 13.</note> God and Father of us all; We live all under
<pb facs="tcp:20216:4"/> one gratious King, and there is ſmall or no <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 13.</note> difference in our language: we differ not as the <note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Cananites</hi> and theſe of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> yee ſay <hi>ſibboleth</hi> and we ſay <hi>ſhibboleth,</hi> yee ſpeake the Dialect of <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 73.</note> 
               <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and we the Dialect of <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſmall or no difference. But the reaſon wherefore I made choiſe of your honour, is the good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which I heare of you every where, your name ſmelleth as the wine of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> yee have put on righteouſneſſe as a garment, yee are eyes to the blind and feete to the lame: <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 7.</note> the bleſſing of him that is ready to periſh <note place="margin">Iob 29. 14.</note> commeth upon you, and you have cauſed the widowes heart to ſing for joy I here were many notable and excellent parts in <hi>Iob,</hi> he deſpiſed not the counſell of his man-ſervant or of his maid-ſervant, here was his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: yet when he ſate in judgement, what grace and majeſtie had he? they gave eare and kept ſilence at his counſell; the young men ſaw him and hid themſelves, and the aged aroſe and ſtood up before him; he was hoſpitable to the poore, he did not eate his <note place="margin">Iob. 30. 1.</note> morſels alone, he was pitifull to the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and to the widdow, and he diſdained the wicked, that he would not ſet them with the dogges of his flocke: happy is that Land
<pb facs="tcp:20216:5"/> where there are ſuch judges. Another cauſe which moved me to grace this worke with your Lordſhips name, is the deſire I have, that others may reade it the more willingly for their owne profit, and even as a faire entrie leadeth the beholder to looke more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly upon every part of the building: ſo the beholder of this worke ſet out under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of your honours vertue, will the more earneſtly affect the peruſing of the ſame, in confidence that ſo much worth as is eminent in your Lordſhip would hinder any mans boldneſſe to preſent unto you a trifle. And for concluſion, when <hi>Jacob</hi> was to ſend his ſonne <hi>Benjamin</hi> into Aegypt, he prayed that <note place="margin">Gen. 42. 14.</note> God Almighty would give him favour before the man: So my earneſt prayer to God is, that this treatiſe may firſt be acceptable to the Church of God, and then unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: And ſo I have obtained that which I deſire. The grace of God be with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and make that the long continuance in the charge which his Majeſtie moſt worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath layd upon you, may produce long happineſſe to this Common wealth.</p>

               </gap>, to cenſure and diſcerne the true reading from the falſe as the <hi>Maſoreth</hi> did who excelled in this. In the warres there are three ſorts of ſignes to direct the Souldiers, <hi>muta, ſemivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calia &amp; vocalia: Muta,</hi> as the enſignes, <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocalia,</hi> as the trumpets: <hi>Vocalia</hi> as the words of the Captaine: So ſome ſignes are <hi>Muta,</hi> as Arts and Sciences; <hi>Semivocalia,</hi> as the knowledge of the tongues; and <hi>Vocalia,</hi> as the meaning of the holy
<pb facs="tcp:20216:6"/> Ghoſt ſpeaking in the Scriptures. The knowledge of theſe is moſt neceſsarie for you who intend to apply your minds to the ſtudie of Divinitie: for by them ye ſhall underſtand the Properties and Phraſes of the holy Gboſt, the ancient cuſtomes of the people of God, and the ſweet alluſions in the third, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ye ſhall never bee able to underſtand. And if ye begin to learne theſe tongues when ye are young, to what great perfection may ye attaine unto before ye come to be teachers of others? <hi>Cicero</hi> maketh mention of <hi>Marcus Craſſus,</hi> who walking one day <note place="margin">Cicero De oratore:</note> upon the ſea ſhore, ſaw a boy who had found a boate there, but he having no helpes to further him to ſaile; firſt he got Oares, then a Maſt, raes, ſailes, and ropes, and then he ſet to the Sea: ſo from little beginnings, if ye be willing, ye may attaine to a great meaſure of knowledge, having ſuch helpes in this age, which your Fathers never knew, and the gleanings of <hi>Ephraim</hi>

The Iewes ſay; <hi>Qui diſcit a junioribus cui ſimilis eſt? Edenti uvas acerbas, &amp; bibenti è torcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari: at qui diſcit à Senioribus cui ſimilis? Edenti uvas maturas &amp; bibenti vinum vetus.</hi> Ye need not ſet your teeth on edge with ſowre Grapes, for now ye have ſtore of ripe Grapes gathered by your old Maſters. The ſluggard that keepeth his hand in
<pb facs="tcp:20216:7"/> his boſome, and ſaith, there is a Lyon in the way; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that the Jewes are but fabulous, and that it <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 13.</note> is but loſt time to read them: but remember that hee ſaid well, who ſaid, <hi>Malogranatum inveni, corti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem abjeci, &amp; quod intus eſt comedi.</hi> Caſt away the unprofitable things and make choiſe of that which is profitable. Others ſay, they cannot attaine to ſuch perfection in theſe tongues as the Tranſlators have done who have Tranſlated the Scriptures already: and therefore they will content themſelves with their travels; but how ſhall they know whether they have tranſlated well or not? They muſt give credit onely to the bearer, and if the Trench-man faile them, then they are gone. The Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> was much more delighted to heare <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelfe ſpeake than heare of him by report, for ſhe ſaid ſhe <note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 7.</note> beleeved not that which was reported of him; and yet the halfe was not told her: ſo brethren, when ye heare an Interpreter ſpeake, ſcarce the halfe is told you: but when ye ſee it in the originall tongues, then ye will ſay; it was true which was ſpoken, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that is in them exceedeth the report which wee heard. There is ſuch profunditie in the Scriptures, that all the wits of men can never ſound the depth of them; it fareth with them as it did with the widdowes <note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.</note> Oyle, it laſted as long as the Children brought veſſels: ſo there is much ſtore and plentie in them, that when
<pb facs="tcp:20216:7"/> they have filled the wits and underſtandings of the beſt, yet there is enough to bee gotten out of them, by thoſe who come after. And here I cannot let paſſe how much theſe honourable Patrons are to bee reſpected, who entertaine and cheriſh theſe profeſſors in the tongues, for without ſuch, knowledge would ſoone decay. <hi>David</hi> made a ſtatute in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they who taried by the ſtuffe ſhould part alike with thoſe who went to battell. The profeſſors of the tongues are they who keepe the ſtuffe, and they ſhould bee as well rewarded as they who goe to the field and fight <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 24.</note> in the miniſterie. I have indevoured (brethren) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my meane meaſure of knowledge to make a little path unto you, to encourage you, and to let you ſee what profit you may have by this kind of ſtudie, and how it may ſerue you in your miniſterie, and if ye reap any benefit by it, be thankefull to the God of heaven the Father of lights from whom all good things deſcend, and then to my Noble Patron my <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> who doth incourage me much to go on in this kinde of ſtudie. And now when we have made ſome progreſſe in this firſt Schoole, and have attained to ſome meaſure of knowledge, ſee that your knowledge turne not like the waters of <hi>Iordan</hi> that run into the dead Sea, but let them be like thoſe waters which come from the Sea and returne to the Sea againe, let them returne to the praiſe of him who gave them. Next when ye <note place="margin">

But faith the daughter of Divinity, aſcendeth higher than reaſon or ſenſe, and the further that it goes from ſenſe and reaſon the more perfect it is, and it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from <hi>minus univerſale,</hi> to the ſupreame and higheſt cauſe, God himſelfe; and the neerer that faith commeth to reaſon or ſenſe, the weaker it is and more indiſtinct. <hi>Thomas</hi> his faith was an indiſtinct faith and weake, and could not beleeve unleſſe hee put his fingers in the wounds of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 28. here his faith leaned too much to ſenſe; but faith the higher that it goes from ſenſe and reaſon, the more perfect it is; We have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example of this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> tooke <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſe, Ephraim</hi> in his right hand towards <hi>Iſraels</hi> left hand, and brought him neere unto him, and <hi>Manaſſe</hi> in his left hand toward <hi>Iſraels</hi> right hand, <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtretched out his right hand and laid it upon <hi>Ephraims</hi> head, and his left hand upon <hi>Manaſſes</hi> head, guiding his hands wittingly, or as <hi>Onkelos</hi> the Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt hath it, <hi>Prudenter egit manibus ſuis,</hi> when he dealt wiſely with his hands: But when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſaw that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laid his right hand upon the head of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> it

This is then the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of faith, that the higher that it goes from ſence and reaſon the more perfect it is, which ſheweth the excellency of Divinity above all other Sciences and Artes; for if faith the daughter of Divinity ſurpaſſeth them all, much more doth Divinity it ſelfe: and it may bee ſaid of faith, as it was ſaid of the vertuous woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. <hi>Many daughters in Iſrael have done vertuouſly, but thou ſurpaſſeſt them all.</hi>

                  <p>There are three principles from whence Sciences <note place="margin">A compariſon betwixt Divinity and other Sciences.</note> and Arts are derived, the firſt is contemplation, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is action, the third is operation.</p>
                  <p>For contemplation, the metaphyſicks are the moſt abſtract, conſidering <hi>ens ut ens</hi> onely: the ſecond are the mathematicks, which conſidereth the quantity and

                  <p>Theſe who are exerciſed in actions and morall phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, are lawes and ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Arts which are exerciſed in operation are rhetoricke and grammer.</p>
                  <p>Metaphyſicke conſidereth God onely, <hi>ut ens vnum,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A compariſon betwixt Divinity and Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks.</note> 
                     <hi>verum et bonum,</hi> as he hath a being, as he is one, as hee is truth and goodneſſe; but it conſidereth not God as Creator, Chriſt as Redeemer, it conſidereth not God in his attributes as Divinity doth, &amp; therefore they ſay <hi>metaphyſica parit ſcientiam tantum, ſed theologia fidem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, compare Divinity with phyſicke and <note place="margin">A compariſon betwixt Divinity, Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and Phyſicks.</note> the mathematicks, the mathematician ſearcheth viſible formes in viſible things, the Phyſition inviſible formes in viſible things; but the Divine inviſible formes in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, let us compare the Divine, the Lawyer and <note place="margin">A compariſon betwixt the Divine, the Lawyer, and the Phyſition.</note> Phyſitian; the Phyſitian <hi>eſt miniſter naturae,</hi> the ſervant of nature, the Lawyer <hi>eſt miniſter juſtitiae,</hi> but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>eſt miniſter gratiae:</hi> and looke how farre grace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth nature or juſtice, ſo as farre doth Divinity ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the Phyſitian or the Lawyer.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, let us compare Divinity and morall philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, <note place="margin">A compariſon betwixt the Divine, and morall Philoſopher.</note> the Philoſopher ſaith, that <hi>Iuvenis non eſt idone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us auditor moralis Philoſophiae,</hi> that a young man is not fit to heare morall philoſophy, but <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 9. <hi>Wherewith ſhall a young man cleanſe his wayes. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> hath a good obſervation to ſhew the force of Divinity above all morall philoſophie, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth <hi>Plato</hi> the moraliſt and <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith he, that wiſe Philoſopher came three times to <hi>Sicilie</hi> to convert <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the tyrant to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall philoſophy, yet he went away without any ſucceſſe:

                  </p>
                  <p>Let us conſider firſt what is above the reach of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">Things that reaſon is not able to do in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and matters of Faith.</note> in Divinity. Firſt, reaſon cannot bee a judge in matters Divine, for reaſon can never judge of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſupernaturall verity. Reaſon ſheweth this much to a man: when it ſeeth the antecedent and the conſequent, that this followeth rightly upon that: but reaſon never judgeth of the object of ſupernaturall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but Divinity enlighteneth the mind and maketh the ſpirituall man to judge of this. A Carpenter when he is working, doth ſee by his eye when he applieth the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                     </label> ſquare to the wood, whether it be ſtreight or not; but yet his eye (without the which he cannot ſee) is not the judge to try whether the tree be ſtreight or not, but onely the ſquare is the judge: So reaſon in man (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which he could not judge) is not the ſquare to try what is right or what is wrong, but the Word it ſelfe is onely the rule and ſquare; reaſon cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how faith juſtifieth a man, or whether works bee an effect of faith or not, but reaſon can conclude one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ex conceſſis,</hi> of things granted, if faith be the cauſe and works the effect, then they muſt neceſſarily goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and reaſon goeth no higher.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, no midſt taken from philoſophy can make up a Divine concluſion, neyther would it beget faith in a man. Example, God is not the efficient cauſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20216:22"/> of ſinne, the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> is a terme attributed to God: here if a Divine ſhould goe about to prove eyther by logicke or grounds of metaphyſicke, this concluſion were not a Divine concluſion, whereupon a mans faith might reſt, as if he ſhould reaſon this wayes, No effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe can produce a defect but an effect, God is an efficient cauſe, and ſinne is a defect, therefore God cannot produce ſinne; this were but an humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion and could not beget faith. So if he ſhould rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the grounds of metaphyſicke this wayes, God is <hi>ens entium,</hi> and the properties of <hi>ens</hi> are <hi>vnum verum bonum,</hi> therefore God who is <hi>ens entium</hi> cannot produce ſinne, becauſe hee is goodneſſe it ſelfe; the concluſion were but an humane concluſion and could not beget faith: but if a Divine ſhould prove the ſame by a midſt taken out of the Scriptures, and ſhould rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>All that which is in the world, is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the concupiſcence of the fleſh, or the luſt of the eye, or the pride of life, not from the Father,</hi> this midſt will make up a Divine concluſion which will beget faith in a man, and then the Chriſtian man may ſay to the Philoſopher as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> ſaid unto the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> I beleeve not now for thy reaſon, but for the authority of God, which is the ground of my faith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Philoſophy doth not inlighten the minde with ſpirituall knowledge, it inlightneth the minde one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a generall knowledge whereof <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. when he beleeveth, his reaſon at the firſt is mere paſſive; therefore this ſpeech of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> would be very warily taken, <hi>Philoſophiam</hi>

                     <hi>vocat;</hi> as though philoſophy made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to ſaving faith: And this ſpeech of ſome Divines is harſhly ſpoken, <hi>lumen natura accendit lumen gratiae,</hi> and <hi>Baſils</hi> compariſon muſt not be ſtretched o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver farre, as Dyers before they bring on the moſt

                  <p>In theſe propoſitions againe which are mixtly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, reaſon hath a further hand; example, No naturall body can be in moe places at once, Chriſts body is a naturall body, therefore it cannot be in moe places at once; this is mixtly Divine, for the properties of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body ſheweth us that it cannot be in moe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at once, and the Scripture alſo, ſheweth us that Chriſts body is a naturall body.</p>

                        <hi>Adams</hi> inbred know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and our acquired knowledge, are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſorts of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> yet <hi>Adam</hi> might have had experimentall knowledge, afterward of his inbred knowledge: His inbred know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and our acquired knowledge, are not divers ſorts of knowledge, for as the ſight reſtored to the blind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was miraculous, yet when he ſaw, it was one ſort of ſight with our ſight: ſo theſe inbred habites and acquired habites, are but one ſort of habits; but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20216:29"/> theſe inbred habits in <hi>Adam,</hi> and infuſed habits, were more excellent than acquired habits; for theſe things which God doth, are ſuch that nature cannot produce the like, or ſo perfect: as that wine which Chriſt made miraculouſly at the marriage of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee, Ioh.</hi> 2. <note place="margin">Things done miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, are more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than nature can produce them.</note> was more excellent wine than other naturall wine: ſo when Chriſt cured the blind, their ſight was more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than our naturall ſight; ſo when he made the lame to goe <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 16. So the habites of inbred knowledge in <hi>Adam,</hi> were more perfect than any other ſinfull man could ever attaine unto, after him.</p>
                  <p>The creatures are leſſe than the knowledge of God; <note place="margin">Of the meaſure of <hi>Adams</hi> knowledge.</note> they were equall with the knowledge of <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, but they exceed our knowledge now.

So the creatures are leſſe than Gods ſight; they were equall with <hi>Adams</hi> ſight before his fall, like the greene colour, and they exceed our ſight ſince the fall, as the white colour doth exceede our ſight; and becauſe the heart ſince the fall is not ſo capable and ſo large to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the knowledge of theſe creatures as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fal, therefore it is ſaid, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 29. that <hi>the Lord gave Salomon a wiſe heart as the ſand of the Sea ſhoare,</hi> that is, to know an innumerable kind of things like the ſand of the ſea.

                  <p>FIrſt, let us enquire how theſe firſt Principles which are called <hi>primo-prima,</hi> are made up in the hearts of man. Secondly, how theſe <hi>ſecundo-prima principia</hi> are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20216:32"/> deduced out of theſe. And thirdly, how theſe <hi>principia</hi> make up this which wee call <hi>Conſcience:</hi> and laſtly, we ſhall ſhew that man by this naturall knowledge ingraft in his heart, cannot come to the true and ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe firſt Principles are made up after this manner: The Lord hath put two faculties into the Soule, one which we call ſpeculative in the underſtanding, and another which we call a practik facultie in the will, to proſecute theſe things which the underſtanding ſheweth to her. God hath placed firſt the ſpeculative in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that it might follow that eternall reaſon that is in Gods Law; for as it is the perfection of Art to imitate nature, ſo it is the perfection of nature to imitate this eternall reaſon, which is Gods Law; Then he hath placed the will into the ſoule of man to proſecute thoſe things, which the underſtanding the ſpeculative facultie ſheweth unto it.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome <hi>primo-prima principia,</hi> in the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative <note place="margin">Some principles in the ſpeculative, and ſome in the practicke faculty.</note> faculty, and ſome in the practick facultie; this is a principle in the ſpeculative facultie; <hi>Omne totum est majus ſua parte,</hi> and this is the firſt principle in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctike faculty, the will, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>Whatſoever yee would that men ſhould doe to you, doe yee even ſo to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>primo-prima principia</hi> are not naturally knowne <note place="margin">How the firſt principles are knowne.</note> 
                     <hi>quoad actum perfectum,</hi> but they are <hi>in potentia propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua,</hi> that is, they may be moſt eaſily knowne; for that which is actually perfect in the firſt degree, is alwayes knowne, and as ſoone as the creature exiſteth, ſo ſoone they are knowne; as the knowledge of an Angel is not potentiall but ever actuall: but theſe firſt principles are made up without any reaſoning diſcourſe or foraigne helpe. And as it is naturall for a ſtone to move downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, although it be not alwayes moving downeward, yet becauſe it hath that weight within it ſelfe, and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20216:33"/> no other helpe to make it move downeward, as it needeth of a foraigne helpe to cauſe it to aſcend; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this motion is ſaid to be naturall to it. So becauſe <note place="margin">How the firſt principles are naturall to the mind.</note> the mind can make up theſe principles without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; therefore they are ſayd to be naturall to it: but when we make up a concluſion in a ſyllogiſme, the knowledge of this concluſion is not ſo eaſily knowne to me: but we muſt borrow ſome midſts, which are more knowne to us, to make up this concluſion. Theſe firſt principles are naturally knowne, but the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the ſyllogiſme is <hi>ratíonaliter</hi> knowne onely, by way of diſcourſe. Theſe firſt principles the Divines <note place="margin">Firſt principles are naturally knowne, but the concluſions are knowne by diſcourſe.</note> call <hi>rationes eternas, dignitates, immobilia principia,</hi> and the Greekes call them <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. If the judgement be ſound and well diſpoſed, then it agreeth to thoſe firſt principles; but if it be corrupt it declineth them. It is not neceſſary that all agree in theſe firſt principles, for although ſome be found who deny them, yet they ſtand as principles to thoſe who are of ſound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; children and mad men underſtand not theſe firſt principles, yet thoſe who are of ſound judgement, doe acknowledge them.</p>

                  <p>And out of theſe <hi>primo-prima principia,</hi> the minde frameth, and maketh up <hi>ſecundo-prima principia:</hi> the

There are other concluſions drawne from theſe <hi>ſecundo-prima principia,</hi> which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Difference betweene the concluſions drawne from the firſt principles, and the concluſions drawne from the ſecond inbred principles.</note> 
                     <hi>tertiae concluſiones,</hi> and theſe are not ſo eaſily made up as the firſt; here the concluſions are contained in the principles, and not the principles in the concluſions as before; example, <hi>honour thy father, and thy mother;</hi> this is a ſecond principle; and this; <hi>thou ſhalt riſe up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hoare head, Livit.</hi> 19. 23. is a concluſion of the third ſort: for this followeth not ſo clearely as the former concluſion, <hi>Yee ſhall riſe up before the hoare head;</hi> therefore yee <hi>ſhall honour your father and your mother:</hi> but rather this wayes, yee ſhall honour your father and your mother; therefore yee ſhall riſe up before the hoare head: heare the concluſion is contained in the principle and not contra.</p>

                     </gap>, and they reſpect more the end here, wherefore they were put into the breſtplate, than their proper ſignifications. For as <hi>Vrim</hi> properly ſignifieth brightneſſe, and figuratively <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>Secondly, put the caſe that <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified doctrine and verity, yet it will not follow that the Highprieſt might not erre: for by theſe were ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified not what ſort of men they were, but what ſort of men they ought to be. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 10. <hi>A divine ſentence is in the lippes of the King, and his mouth tranſgreſſeth not in judgement.</hi> Here is a clearer place that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> cannot erre in judgement, than that the Pope cannot erre in judgement; if yee will take words as they ſtand. But the meaning of the words is, a divine ſentance ought to be in the lippes of the King; and then his mouth will not tranſgreſſe in judgement. So theſe two are ſet in the breſtplate of <hi>Aaron,</hi> to teach him his dutie: but they were not notes of his infallibility. And if by <hi>Vrim,</hi> they would inferre his infallibility in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo by <hi>Thimmim,</hi> they may inferre his holineſſe of life: and ſo none of the Popes were profane and wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this breſtplate ſerved not for a triall of his doctrine, but onely for foretelling of the doubtfull events of things; for their doctrine was to be tryed by the law and by the teſtimony, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> ſignified verity and <note place="margin">The High prieſts might erre.</note> judgement, then it ſhould follow, that none of the Highprieſts could erre: but wee know that <hi>Vrijah</hi> the Highprieſt in the time of <hi>Achaz,</hi> brought the paterne of the Altar of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and placed it in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 6. And <hi>Caaiphas</hi> erred, when he condemned Chriſt to death.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, let this be granted, that the Highprieſt under the law could not erre; therefore that eyther <hi>Peter</hi> or the Pope his ſucceſſor (as they alledge) could not erre, it will not follow. For this priviledge, <hi>not to erre,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, we may anſwer to this: whether the word written be an article of our faith or not. The articles <note place="margin">Articles of our faith, taken generally or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</note> of our faith are eyther taken generally, or ſpecially: ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, for all that is contained in the Scriptures, or may be deduced by way of conſequence from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: then it is not an article of our faith, to beleeve the canon of the Scriptures.

                  <p>The Scriptures of God, are conſidered eſſentially, <note place="margin">The Scriptures conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red eſſentially or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally.</note> or accidentally. Eſſentially, as they proceede from God; accidentally againe, as they were written by ſuch and ſuch men. As they proceede from God, we muſt beleeve them to be true, and to be the meanes of our ſalvation; for ſaving truth is onely from God. But if we conſider them but accidentally, as they are written by ſuch and ſuch men, then it is not an article of our faith to beleeve them; for it maketh not to our
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20216:48"/> ſalvation <hi>primariò,</hi> to know that they were written by ſuch and ſuch men.</p>
                  <p>When the books in holy Scripture, carry the names of thoſe who wrote them; as the bookes of <hi>Moyſes</hi> carrie his name; if a man ſhould deny theſe bookes to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; then be ignorant altogether of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in them; then his ignorance were damnable, and the denyall of them hereticall; they <note place="margin">Ignorantia damnabilis negatio haretica.</note> have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>But if the writer of the booke be not ſet downe in the Scripture; if a man ſhould deny ſuch a man to write it, he ſhould not be reputed as an hereticke for that; and to be ignorant that ſuch a man wrote it, this <note place="margin">Negatia eſt haerètica per accidens ſed igneratio non eſt damnabilis.</note> were not damnable ignorance. Example, it is holden that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote the Epiſtle to the Hebrews; now if a man ſhould deny that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle, he were not to be holden a hereticke for that, neyther were his ignorance damnable. A man may be ignorant of this or that booke, and yet be ſaved, and many were ſaved before the bookes were written, and now many are ſaved who cannot reade the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>But when a man doubteth of the order and number <note place="margin">Ignorantia hic eſt infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatis &amp; negatio eſt hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritica per accidens.</note> of the bookes in the Canon, this argueth but his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilfulneſſe and infirmity, and the denyall of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and order of theſe bookes, is but hereticall by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and the ignorance is not damnable.</p>
                  <p>When we beleeve ſuch a booke to be written by ſuch <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> a man, whether beleeve we this by a juſtifying faith, or by an hiſtoricall faith?</p>
                  <p>When we beleeve that ſuch a man wrote this booke, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The Character, in which the Old Teſtament was <note place="margin">In what character the Scriptures were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at the firſt.</note> written firſt, was the <hi>Samaritane</hi> Character; It was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Samaritane</hi> Character, not becauſe the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> uſed it firſt, but becauſe it was left to the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> after the Iewes refuſed it.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Samaritane</hi> Character was the firſt Character as may be ſeene by the inſcriptions upon their ſhekels ſet <note place="margin">Why called the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane character.</note> downe by <hi>Arius Montanus, Beza,</hi> and <hi>Willet</hi> upon <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> And ſundry of the Iewes ancient monuments have theſe letters upon them.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, we deſcribe that which is naturall, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from ſome defect of the organs, as if he ſpake with a weake voyce, or be of a ſtammering tongue, or thicke lippes, which <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 12, are called <hi>Vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed lippes:</hi> Contrary to this is a thinne lippe which is a ſigne of Eloquence, <hi>Iob.</hi> 12. 20. for theſe who have thinne lippes, commonly are Eloquent. <hi>Moſes</hi> the Penman of the holy Ghoſt, although he was defective in ſpeech; yet read his writings, and yee ſhall ſee ſuch <note place="margin">The writers of the Scriptures although weake in perſon yet powerfull in words.</note> eloquence in him, that no Heathen could ever match it, and as it is ſayd of <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was preſent in perſon he was weake, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>and his ſpeech baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible yet his letters were weighty and powerfull:</hi> ſo whatſoever want or infirmity was in <hi>Moyſes</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet there was no want or defect in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:20216:67"/>
                  <p> Secondly, in what language hee ſpeaketh. The holy Ghoſt ſpake and wrote in Hebrew in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">The Old Teſtament was written in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and the New in Greeke.</note> and in the New in Greeke. Hee wrote the Old Teſtament in Hebrew, a language which had this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſpoken of in the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 12. <hi>Thou ſhalt lend and not borrow,</hi> ſo this language lendeth to many Nations, but borroweth of none.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in what Dialect he ſpeaketh. The Dialects of the Hebrew tongue were ſundry, firſt, <hi>Dialectus Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſolymitana,</hi> that Dialect which was ſpoken in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and about it, <hi>Ast.</hi> 1. 19. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Dialect, or proper tongue.</hi> So the Dialect of the <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> who ſayd, <hi>Sibboleth</hi> &amp; not <hi>Shibboleth, Iud.</hi> 12. 6. and the Dialect of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake in the <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean</hi> Dialect, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 73.

                        <hi>Carmen.</hi>
                     </note> and Canticles.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>Oratio ſoluta</hi>
                     </note> the moſt of the prophets.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the property of the ſpeech. The phraſe in Hebrew is much to be obſerved, for in the Hebrew it will ſignifie one thing, and in other languages, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing.</p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:20216:67"/>
                  <p> Example, <hi>Num.</hi> 19. 20. <hi>Dies numeri,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>A few</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Dies numeri quid apud Hebraos.</note> 
                     <hi>dayes,</hi> ſo <hi>Homines numeri, Gen.</hi> 34. 30. <hi>A few men, Deut.</hi> 4. 27. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12. 16. So <hi>Eſay</hi> 10. 19. <hi>The reſt of the Trees of his Forreſt ſhall be number, that a child may write them,</hi> that is, <hi>They ſhall be few.</hi> In other languages this phraſe would ſignifie <hi>many men,</hi> and <hi>many trees, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So ſome phraſes of the Scripture have a contrary <note place="margin">Some phraſes with the Hebrewes have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſignification.</note> ſignification with the Hebrews, as <hi>Zack.</hi> 11. 24. <hi>Aſcendit viſio a me,</hi> that is, <hi>It periſhed.</hi> So <hi>Ier.</hi> 47. 15. <hi>Moab is ſpoyled and gone up out of her Cities,</hi> that is, Shee is deſtroyed. Sometimes againe it ſignifieth to waxe and increaſe, as 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 35. <hi>Bellum aſcendit, The battell increaſed.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 23. <hi>The tumult that ariſe up againſt thee aſcendeth,</hi> that is, <hi>Increaſeth continually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Levare peccatum</hi> is to take off the burden of ſinne, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 17. and <hi>Iohn</hi> alludeth to this, 1. 29. <hi>Behold the Lambe of God that taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</hi>

                        </note> wherefore <hi>Philadelphus</hi> ſo hated him was this: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when <hi>Ptolomeus Lagi</hi> his father had maried a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond wife called <hi>Eurice</hi> (as he had <hi>Bernice</hi> the mother of <hi>Ptolemeus Philadelphus</hi> for his firſt wife) this <hi>Dime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> perſwaded <hi>Ptolomeus Lagi</hi> to diſinherit the ſonne of <hi>Bernice,</hi> and to give the crowne to the ſonne of the ſecond wife <hi>Eurice;</hi> which when <hi>Ptolomeus Philadelphus</hi> underſtood, after his fathers death he preſently ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him.

                        </note> his raigne, is there any probability that he had the charge of this Library? and <hi>Vitruvius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophanes</hi> that noble Grammarian had the keeping of this Library; and not <hi>Dimetrius Phalerius.</hi>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20216:88"/> Tribes were ſcattered amongſt them; yet it is certaine that theſe had no place amongſt them, becauſe the moſt part of them were caried away captive by the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> This handfull which were yet left in <hi>Iudea,</hi> had no authority amongſt them, and how came it to paſſe that they ſent the whole <hi>Synedrion</hi> or the great Councill to <hi>Egypt?</hi> beſides, the <hi>Synedrion</hi> conſiſted not of the twelve Tribes after the captivity, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda;</hi> and is it probable that they would ſend theſe <hi>Seventy</hi> to <hi>Egypt?</hi> and if it bee true which they ſay of theſe ſeverall Cels in which they were placed, when they tranſlated the Bible; then it behooved every one of them, to have ſuch a ſufficient meaſure of knowledge both in Hebrew and Greeke, that they might have finiſhed the whole Worke alone; which no man will beleeve.</p>

                     <p>Againe wee may demande of them, whether will they preferre the Vulgar tranſlation to the Hebrew and Greeke? The groſſer of the Papiſts are not aſhamed, to preferre it to them both, and they ſay, wee have no neede to have recourſe to the originall, to try whether it be Authenticke or not, the Vulgar Latine being now eſtabliſhed by the Councill. And <hi>Ludovicus a Tena</hi> ſaith, although the books in the originall both Hebrew and <note place="margin">

And <hi>Oſorius</hi> ſaith, if we ſhould grant that the Interpreter <note place="margin">

                     <p>The Moderne Papiſts preferre it not ſimply to the Hebrew and Greeke, as <hi>Gretſerus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Sufficit aequatio, non praelatio:</hi> But they ſay, that they will not have their tranſlation examined and tryed by the Hebrew and Greeke; for how know we (ſay they) that theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies which we have now, agree with the firſt originall Copie? we have the judgement of the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this tranſlation, but not concerning the Hebrew and Greeke. But if it bee in the Churches power to make a tranſlation or to authorize it, why will they not
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:20216:93"/> authorize the Hebrew and Greeke rather than the Vulgar Latine tranſlation?</p>
                     <p>And if they inact the Vulgar Latine to be Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke and the onely rule to decide controverſies, what ſhall become of all the Churches in the Eaſt that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not the Latine; ſhall they under the paine of a curſe receive this tranſlation?</p>
                     <p>When the Vulgar tranſlation was concluded in the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> onely to be the Authenticke tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation in their Diſputations, Sermons, and Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Some oppoſed againſt this, and ſaid, that it was a hard thing for the Church, to judge that onely to bee Authenticke, which one man had done. And <hi>Aloyſius Catenaas</hi> ſayd, that no man could know what a Verſion meant, but by the Originall; and he alledged for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>Cajetans</hi> authority in the Councill, who being Legate for the Pope in <hi>Germanie, Anno</hi> 1523. was wont to ſay, that the onely remedy to refell Heretickes, was to underſtand the literall ſenſe out of the originall tongues, and he ſayd now, that the Cardinall would ſpend the reſt of his dayes in ſtudying of the tongues, that hee might bee the more fit to convince the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes; which he did, and he gave himſelfe to this ſtudie eleven yeares before he dyed.</p>
                     <p>Againe there was much contention among them concerning the meaning of this Canon made in the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> whether this tranſlation was the judge in matters of faith or manners onely? or was it ſo ſtrictly to be taken that it failed not one jote, and that <hi>Mathematice</hi> it was ſo perfect and not <hi>Moraliter</hi> onely? <hi>Andreas vega</hi> who was preſent at the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> holden under Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third, ſaith; when the Tridentine Fathers call the vulgar Latine tranſlation, the Authenticke tranſlation, they meane no other thing but this, that it was not corrupted with
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:20216:94"/> errours, and that it might bee ſafely read and uſed to a mans ſalvation; and he concludeth, that the authority which the Councill gave to this tranſlation, is not to be taken <hi>infinitivè,</hi> but <hi>definitivè</hi> with certaine limitations. But if this was the meaning of the Councill, that the faithfull might ſafely read it, becauſe there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of errour; then what authority or prerogative had this verſion by the Councill, above that tranſlation of <hi>Pagnine</hi> for the Doctors of <hi>Lovan</hi> by the approbation of the Pope, put the tranſlation of <hi>Pagnine</hi> with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Text. But the former Catholickes ſay, that hee who tranſlated the Hebrew into the Vulgar Latine, was not an Interpreter, but a Prophet: but how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it that others ſay now, that this Interpreter might erre, although not groſſely? that he might erre, not in <hi>fide &amp; moralibus,</hi> but in leſſer matters? and ſo they will have the Councill to be underſtood; but they of old ſayd plainely, that in every thing this tranſlation was Authenticke.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, when wee demand of them whether the Church may make a new Verſion yet or not? or mend that which is alreadie done? <hi>Gretſerus</hi> who taketh the defence of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> againſt <hi>Whittaker,</hi> denyeth that <note place="margin">

But <hi>Serrarius</hi> holdeth, that this Verſion may be yet helped, and that it is not come yet to ſuch a perfection, but that it may grow to a greater; if the Church would condeſcend.</p>
                     <p>The tranſlation of the <hi>Seventy</hi> although the Apoſtles themſelves followed it in many things, yet it was never holden to be Originall and Divine, by the Church, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were the Churches commanded to receive it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paine of a curſe. <hi>Hierome</hi> marketh in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face upon the firſt of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> that the Churches of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> followed the Tranſlation
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:20216:94"/> of <hi>Heſychius</hi> (which was a tranſlation ſet forth after the <hi>Seventies</hi> tranſlation) rather then the tranſlation of the <hi>Seventy:</hi> but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>The Syriack tranſlation was firſt tranſlated into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine by <hi>Guido Fabricius,</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Tremellius. Genebrard</hi> and <hi>Serarius</hi> taking occaſion upon this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, charged <hi>Tremellius</hi> with great forgerie. Firſt, that he tooke away all the Titles from the Epiſtles; but this was no forgerie: for neyther the Superſcriptions nor the Subſcriptions are any part of the Canonicall Scripture, as may be ſeene before in the poſtſcripts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Syriacke tranſlation. Secondly, they charge him, that he tooke away the Calender, for the reading of the Goſpel upon holy dayes: but neyther the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Calender, nor the Syriacke Calender, are Divine Scripture; and that uſe, for which they ſay this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender ſerved, for reading of the Goſpel upon holy dayes; was onely uſed in the weſterne Romiſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but not in the Eaſterne Churches. Thirdly, they ſay that he committed <hi>Plagium</hi> in ſtealing his tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Guido Fabricius,</hi> and ſetting it out under his owne name: but what diligence he uſed in tranſlation of the Syriack, he who wrote his life teſtifieth. And
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:20216:95"/> will any man thinke that he who was a native Iew, borne and trained up in theſe tongues, was ſo ignorant, that he had no skill, but that which he did ſteall from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and <hi>Gretſerus</hi> addeth, that firſt he was a Iew, and then he became a Monke, thirdly, a Calvaniſt or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonite, and laſtly, that hee returned to his vomite againe, and dyed a Iew. But that yee may perceive what a Railer this was, who ſpared neyther the living nor the dead, I will ſet downe a memorable proofe of his death; he who wrote <hi>Apophthegmata morientium,</hi> (the notable ſayings which ſundry uttered at the laſt houre of their death,) relateth this of him. When they demanded of him what confeſſion hee would make of his faith? he ſayd, <hi>Vivat Chriſtus &amp; pereat Barabbas.</hi> Whereas the reſt of the Iewes cryed, <hi>Vivat Barabbas, &amp; pereat Chriſtus,</hi> this he ſayd to ſignifie that he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Iudaiſme, and tooke him onely to the merites of Chriſt. Was this to dye like a Iew? the Name of this worthy man ſhould ſmell to us as the Wine of <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. Hoſ.</hi> 14. 7.</p>

And he applyeth this promiſe literally to his ſonne <hi>Salomon,</hi> and figuratively to Chriſt his Sonne; taking the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:20216:107"/> in a larger extent; and the matter may be cleared by this compariſon. A father hath a ſonne who is farre from him, he biddeth the Tailor ſhape a coate to him, and to take the meaſure by another child who is there preſent, but withall hee biddeth the Taylor make it larger; becauſe his child will waxe taller: So this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>David</hi> was firſt cut out (as it were) for <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> his ſonne, but yet it had a larger extent: for it is applyed to Chriſt who is greater than <hi>Salomon:</hi> and as by a ſphere of wood wee take up the celeſtiall ſpheres: So by the promiſes made to <hi>David</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Salomon,</hi> we take up him who is greater than <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> and theſe two make but up one ſenſe. When a man fixeth his eye upon one to behold him, another man accidentally commeth in, in the meane time; hee caſteth his eyes upon that man alſo: So the Lords eye was principally upon the Meſſias, but hee did caſt a looke, as it were, alſo to <hi>Salomon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When theſe teſtimonies are applyed in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <note place="margin">A Scripture diverſely applyed, doth make up but one literall ſenſe.</note> the literall ſenſe is made up ſometimes of the type and the thing typed. Example, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 36. <hi>A bone of him ſhall not be broken.</hi> This is ſpoken both of the bones of the Paſchall Lambe, and of the bones of Chriſt; and both of them make up but one literall ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the literall ſenſe is made up <hi>ex hiſtorico &amp; allegorico,</hi> as <hi>Sara</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> the bond woman and the free, ſignifie the children of the promiſe begotten by grace, and the bond ſervants under the Law; and theſe two make up but one ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes <hi>ex tropologico &amp; literali,</hi> as, <hi>Ye ſhall not muſsle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corne,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the literall ſenſe is made up <hi>ex hiſtorico, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtico &amp; prophetico.</hi> Example, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 15. <hi>A voyce was</hi>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:20216:108"/> 
                     <hi>heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for children, refuſing to bee comforted for her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren becauſe they were not.</hi> There was a voyce heard in <hi>Ramah</hi> for <hi>Ephraims</hi> captivity, that is, for the ten Tribes who came of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Rahel,</hi> this mourning was becauſe the ten Tribes ſhould not be brought backe againe from the captivity, this was myſticall and not propheticall, that ſhee mourned for the ten Tribes who were led away into captivity; but it was propheticall foretelling the cruell murther which <hi>Herod</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in killing the infants not farre from <hi>Rahels</hi> grave; all theſe are comprehended in this propheſie, and make up one full ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>When a teſtimony is cited out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the new, the Spirit of God intendeth, that this is the proper meaning in both the places, and that they make not up two divers ſenſes. Example, the Lord ſaith, <hi>make fat the hearts of this people, Eſa.</hi> 6. 9. and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>In them is fulfilled this propheſie.</hi> This judgement <hi>to make fat the hearts,</hi> was denounced againſt the Iewes in <hi>Eſaias</hi> time at the firſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 16. <hi>Well ſpakethe holy Ghoſt by Iſaiah the Prophet,</hi> it was fulfilled upon the Iewes who lived both in Chriſts time and in <hi>Pauls</hi> time. <hi>Eſay</hi> when he denounced this threatning, he meant not onely of the Iewes who lived then, but alſo of the Iewes who were to come after; and it was lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fulfilled upon them all.</p>
                  <p>Example, 2. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61. 7. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath annointed me to preach the Goſpel,</hi> this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is cited by Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 18. and it is onely meant of Chriſt, and literally to be applyed to him.</p>
                  <p>Example 3. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 49. 6. <hi>I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles,</hi> Chriſt went not in proper perſon to preach to the Gentiles himſelfe, but he went to them by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, therefore <hi>Act.</hi> 31. 47. <hi>Paul ſaith, the Lord hath</hi>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:20216:108"/> 
                     <hi>commanded me to goe and be a light to the Gentiles,</hi> this is the proper ſenſe and meaning of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> in this place.</p>
                  <p>When the teſtimonies of the Old Teſtament are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the new, they are not cited by way of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, but becauſe they are the proper meaning of the places; if they were cited by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles onely by way of accommodation; then the Iewes might have taken exception, and ſayd, that theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies made nothing againſt them: becauſe it was not the meaning of the holy Ghoſt who indited theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſpeake againſt them. But Chriſt and his Apoſtles bring out theſe teſtimonies, as properly meant of them, and not by way of accommodation onely.</p>

                  <p>Where there are two ſeverall teſtimonies found in the old Teſtament, and joyned together in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, theſe two make but one literall ſenſe, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 62. 11. <hi>Say to the daughter of Sion, behold thy Salvation cometh.</hi> So <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 9. <hi>O Daughter of Sion, O Daughter of Ieruſalem, behold thy King commeth riding upon an Aſſe, and upon an Aſſe Coalt: Matthew</hi> citing theſe places <hi>cap.</hi> 23. joyneth them both together, and ſheweth that both <hi>Eſay</hi> and <hi>Zacharie</hi> meant of Chriſt comming in humilitie and not in glorie, and theſe two make up but one literall ſenſe.</p>
